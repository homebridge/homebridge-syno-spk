## Installation

This package will deploy Homebridge and the Homebridge UI natively on your Synology NAS. It will create a new shared named `homebridge` to store the Homebridge configuration and user data.

#### Dependencies

This package will leverage the Synology supplied NodeJS v18 package 

#### Add the Homebridge Synology Package Source:

1. Open Package Center in DSM and select the `Settings` option.
2. Select the `Package Sources` tab.
3. Click `Add`
4. In the `Name` section enter `Homebridge`
5. In the `Location` section enter `https://synology.homebridge.io`
6. Click `OK`

#### Install Homebridge:

1. Go back to Package Center and search for `Homebridge`
2. Click on the `Homebridge` package then select `Install`
3. Click `Agree` when warned about using a package from an unknown publisher.
4. Click `Done` to confirm installation. 

*Please note low power device make take 10-15 minutes to install the package.*

Once the install has completed, a new Homebridge menu item will be shown in DSM which will open the Homebridge UI.

The Homebridge UI app starts on port `8581`.

If you have the Synology Firewall enabled, make a rule to allow access to port 8581 and the port Homebridge was assigned too.
